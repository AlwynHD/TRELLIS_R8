<!-- Updates -->
## ‚è© Updates
**12/18/2024**
- Implementation of multi-image conditioning for TRELLIS-image model. ([#7](https://github.com/microsoft/TRELLIS/issues/7)). This is based on tuning-free algorithm without training a specialized model, so it may not give the best results for all input images.
- Add Gaussian export in `app.py` and `example.py`. ([#40](https://github.com/microsoft/TRELLIS/issues/40))

<!-- TODO List -->
## üöß TODO List
- [x] Release inference code and TRELLIS-image-large model
- [ ] Release TRELLIS-text model series
- [ ] Release training code and data

## Model Description

TRELLIS uses a unified Structured LATent (SLAT) representation that enables generation of different 3D output formats. The model deployed here is TRELLIS-image-large, which contains 1.2B parameters and is trained on a diverse dataset of 500K 3D objects.

Key features:
- Generate high-quality 3D assets from input images
- Multiple output formats: 3D Gaussians, Radiance Fields, and textured meshes
- Detailed shape and texture generation
- Support for various viewpoint renderings

For more examples and to try it directly in your browser, visit the [Replicate model page](https://replicate.com/firtoz/trellis).

## Input Format

The model accepts:
- An input image (PNG or JPEG format)
- Optional parameters for controlling the generation process

## Output Format

The model outputs:
- A GLB file containing the generated 3D model with textures
- Preview renders from multiple angles
- Optional: Raw 3D Gaussians or Radiance Field representations

## Example Usage

```python
import replicate

output = replicate.run(
    "firtoz/trellis:version",
    input={
        "seed": 0,
        "image": "https://replicate.delivery/pbxt/M6rvlcKpjcTijzvLfJw8SCWQ74M1jrxowbVDT6nNTxREcvxO/ephemeros_cartoonish_character_art_cyberpunk_crocodile_white_ba_486fb649-bc68-46a0-b429-751b43734b89.png",
        "texture_size": 1024,
        "mesh_simplify": 0.95,
        "generate_color": True,
        "generate_model": True,
        "randomize_seed": True,
        "generate_normal": True,
        "ss_sampling_steps": 12,
        "slat_sampling_steps": 12,
        "ss_guidance_strength": 7.5,
        "slat_guidance_strength": 3
    }
)
print(output)
```

### Local Usage

```python
import imageio
from PIL import Image
from trellis.pipelines import TrellisImageTo3DPipeline
from trellis.utils import render_utils, postprocessing_utils

# Load a pipeline from a model folder or a Hugging Face model hub.
pipeline = TrellisImageTo3DPipeline.from_pretrained("JeffreyXiang/TRELLIS-image-large")
pipeline.cuda()

# Load an image
image = Image.open("assets/example_image/T.png")

# Run the pipeline
outputs = pipeline.run(
    image,
    seed=1,
    # Optional parameters
    # sparse_structure_sampler_params={
    #     "steps": 12,
    #     "cfg_strength": 7.5,
    # },
    # slat_sampler_params={
    #     "steps": 12,
    #     "cfg_strength": 3,
    # },
)
# outputs is a dictionary containing generated 3D assets in different formats:
# - outputs['gaussian']: a list of 3D Gaussians
# - outputs['radiance_field']: a list of radiance fields
# - outputs['mesh']: a list of meshes

# Render the outputs
video = render_utils.render_video(outputs['gaussian'][0])['color']
imageio.mimsave("sample_gs.mp4", video, fps=30)
video = render_utils.render_video(outputs['radiance_field'][0])['color']
imageio.mimsave("sample_rf.mp4", video, fps=30)
video = render_utils.render_video(outputs['mesh'][0])['normal']
imageio.mimsave("sample_mesh.mp4", video, fps=30)

# GLB files can be extracted from the outputs
glb = postprocessing_utils.to_glb(
    outputs['gaussian'][0],
    outputs['mesh'][0],
    # Optional parameters
    simplify=0.95,          # Ratio of triangles to remove in the simplification process
    texture_size=1024,      # Size of the texture used for the GLB
)
glb.export("sample.glb")

# Save Gaussians as PLY files
outputs['gaussian'][0].save_ply("sample.ply")
```

After running the code, you will get the following files:
- `sample_gs.mp4`: a video showing the 3D Gaussian representation
- `sample_rf.mp4`: a video showing the Radiance Field representation
- `sample_mesh.mp4`: a video showing the mesh representation
- `sample.glb`: a GLB file containing the extracted textured mesh
- `sample.ply`: a PLY file containing the 3D Gaussian representation

### Web Demo

[app.py](app.py) provides a simple web demo for 3D asset generation. Since this demo is based on [Gradio](https://gradio.app/), additional dependencies are required:
```sh
. ./setup.sh --demo
```

After installing the dependencies, you can run the demo with the following command:
```sh
python app.py
```

Then, you can access the demo at the address shown in the terminal.

***The web demo is also available on [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/JeffreyXiang/TRELLIS)!***
